    "* *Goal*: Group similar transactions based on the items purchased.\n",
    "* *Method*: Techniques like K-means clustering could be applied to identify groups of similar purchase behaviors. For example, customers who frequently buy plush toys might cluster together, while those who buy calendars and mugs form another group.\n",

    "* *Goal*: Discover relationships between items purchased together.\n",
    "* *Method*: This is what you did with the Apriori algorithm, which is a form of unsupervised learning. It identified that customers who buy a Penguin Mug are also likely to buy a Penguin Plush Toy. This reveals a hidden pattern of purchasing behavior that can inform marketing strategies.\n",

    "### Frequent Itemsets Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Item Frequencies**:\n",
    "   - **Penguin Mug**: Support of 0.8 (80% of transactions include this item)  \n",
    "     - This is the most popular item, indicating it has broad appeal and possibly high demand.\n",
    "   - **Penguin Plush Toy**: Support of 0.6 (60% of transactions)  \n",
    "     - This item is also very popular, but not as much as the mug.\n",
    "   - **Penguin Calendar**: Support of 0.4 (40% of transactions)  \n",
    "   - **Penguin T-Shirt**: Support of 0.4 (40% of transactions)  \n",
    "   - **Penguin Keychain**: Support of 0.3 (30% of transactions)  \n",
    "     - These items have moderate popularity, suggesting they are still relevant but less frequently purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Item Combinations**:\n",
    "   - **(Penguin Mug, Penguin Plush Toy)**: Support of 0.4  \n",
    "     - A significant number of customers buy both items together, indicating a strong association between them.\n",
    "   - **(Penguin Calendar, Penguin Mug)**: Support of 0.3  \n",
    "   - **(Penguin Mug, Penguin T-Shirt)**: Support of 0.3  \n",
    "     - The presence of the mug in these combinations suggests it is a central item in customer purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Association Rules Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rule 1**: If a customer buys **Penguin Mug**, they are likely to buy **Penguin Plush Toy**.\n",
    "   - **Support**: 0.4  \n",
    "   - **Confidence**: 0.5 (50% of those who buy a mug also buy a plush toy)  \n",
    "   - **Lift**: 0.83  \n",
    "     - This indicates a positive relationship, but the lift being less than 1 suggests they are not strongly dependent on each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rule 2**: If a customer buys **Penguin Plush Toy**, they are likely to buy **Penguin Mug**.\n",
    "   - **Support**: 0.4  \n",
    "   - **Confidence**: 0.67 (67% of plush toy buyers also buy a mug)  \n",
    "   - **Lift**: 0.83  \n",
    "     - This shows a mutual relationship, with a stronger confidence when buying the plush toy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rule 3**: If a customer buys **Penguin Calendar**, they are likely to buy **Penguin Mug**.\n",
    "   - **Support**: 0.3  \n",
    "   - **Confidence**: 0.75 (75% of calendar buyers also buy a mug)  \n",
    "   - **Lift**: 0.94  \n",
    "     - The high confidence indicates a strong association, and the lift close to 1 shows they are somewhat related but also frequently bought independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rule 4**: If a customer buys **Penguin T-Shirt**, they are likely to buy **Penguin Mug**.\n",
    "   - **Support**: 0.3  \n",
    "   - **Confidence**: 0.75 (75% of T-shirt buyers also buy a mug)  \n",
    "   - **Lift**: 0.94  \n",
    "     - Similar to the previous rule, this indicates that the mug is a common item in conjunction with the T-shirt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Central Item**: The **Penguin Mug** is a key item in purchases, serving as a strong anchor for other items. Marketing strategies could focus on promoting the mug, possibly bundling it with plush toys or calendars to increase sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Promotion Opportunities**: Since the mug appears frequently with other items, cross-promotional strategies (e.g., discounts or bundle deals) could be employed to encourage customers to buy multiple items together.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stock Management**: Given the high support for the mug, ensure it is well-stocked. Items like the plush toy, calendar, and T-shirt should also be stocked, but their inventory can be adjusted based on their lower support values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Targeted Advertising**: Use the association rules to create targeted advertising campaigns, suggesting related items based on customer purchase history.\n",
